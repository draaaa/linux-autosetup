**Purpose of linux-autosetup**

This repo serves two purposes - firstly, and more importantly, it is an archive of the configs that I use for GNU/Linux. It's second purpose *(which has yet to be implemented)* is to automatically install applications that I use, so that I do not have to manually reinstall every app that I use on a daily basis. Simply put, it is an online backup of my setup so that I do not have to manually reinstall everything on each install.

**Goals of linux-autosetup**
1. To implement a detection method for common distributions for compatability with the different package managers of different distributions
2. To automatically install apps and their respective preferred configurations that are set within the repo
3. To maintain an organized list of configurations that are modifiable by anybody for any* distribution
4. To further develop an understanding of git as well as GNU/Linux
