**Purpose of linux-autosetup**

This repo serves two purposes - firstly, and more importantly, it is an archive of the configs that I use for GNU/Linux. It's second purpose *(which has yet to be implemented)* is to automatically install applications that I use, so that I do not have to manually reinstall every app that I use on a daily basis. Simply put, it is an online backup of my setup so that I do not have to manually reinstall everything on each install.

**Goals of linux-autosetup**
1. To implement a detection method for common distributions for compatability with the different package managers of different distributions
2. To automatically install apps and their respective preferred configurations that are set within the repo
3. To maintain an organized list of configurations that are modifiable by anybody for any* distribution
4. To further develop an understanding of git as well as GNU/Linux

**About Scripts**

At the moment, I'm still debating whether or not I should include virt-manager as something that even comes with this. I probably won't have it install with everything else since it's usecase is relatively niche and not something that's really needed for all of my computers, so if there are any leftover references to virt-manager or commands like virshstart or similar that I don't manage to clear out then feel free to submit an issue.
